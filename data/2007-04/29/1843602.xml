        <p>Joshua Redman</p>
        <p>''Back East'' (Nonesuch) isn't a stopgap or an experiment for the saxophonist Joshua Redman; it's a record that scales back and takes inventory of his roots and strengths. It pulls vigorously toward the example of Sonny Rollins (the title is a play on Mr. Rollins's 1957 album ''Way Out West'') but also, to a lesser extent, toward John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter and Mr. Redman's father, Dewey Redman, who died last year. Mostly, it's a no-nonsense saxophone-trio record -- like ''Way Out West'' -- using three rhythm sections, all of them first-rate. A few songs include Dewey Redman, Chris Cheek or Joe Lovano on second saxophone. (On ''GJ,'' the last track, the elder Redman plays a short piece with one of the rhythm sections, Larry Grenadier on bass and Ali Jackson on drums; the younger Mr. Redman doesn't even appear.) Mr. Redman has been a flexible record maker since he emerged, almost 15 years ago; he can play with almost anyone, and with almost any stylistic intent. But here his simplest record is also his least facile and his clearest of purpose.</p>
        <p>Chu Berry</p>
        <p>Here comes Mosaic Records with another soil-core sample of jazz history, ''Classic Chu Berry Columbia and Victor Sessions,'' a slice through time and context tracing one man's work. The tenor saxophonist Chu Berry (real name: Leon), who died in 1941 at 33, played fast and wisely, with awesome harmonic smarts and a rich, even tone. This seven-disc set amounts to a little less than eight years of recording, but the records came during the end of jazz's bustling innocence, when it was crowded with geniuses and not looking back. Here Mr. Berry moves mostly like a sideman through the orbits of more than a dozen bands, brushing up against one powerhouse after another. There's the plump, easy swing of the Chocolate Dandies records of 1933, directed by Benny Carter; the extreme toughness of Bessie Smith singing ''I'm Down in the Dumps''; the manic energy of Gene Krupa's Swing Band in 1936; the intensive, percussive authority of Clyde Hart's piano soloing in Lionel Hampton's sextet; and Milt Hinton's hummingbird bass pluckings with Cab Calloway's orchestra. And through it all, Mr. Berry sounds ecstatic, playing all over his horn. That he died just as bebop was beginning is a rankling thought. (Available from mosaicrecords.com.)</p>
        <p>Spanish Harlem Orchestra</p>
        <p>This band reminds you of the excitement that is central to the salsa orchestra, a species of band that once flourished and hardly exists anymore. ''United We Swing'' (Six Degrees), the third album by the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, sufficiently updates the 1970s beau ideal of the salsa big band, in intricacies of percussion and the breadth of Oscar Hernandez's arrangements. But when the group truly channels the old days, as in ''En el Tiempo del Palladium,'' the record is all righteous pleasure, with booming brass and vocal improvisations. Paul Simon arrives for the last track, a Latinized version of his song ''Late in the Evening''; it works nicely, but the record has already made its point.</p>
        <p>Michel Camilo</p>
        <p>Depending on what track you're listening to, ''Spirit of the Moment'' (Telarc) is presenting one of three big ideas. There's Latin jazz as we know it. There's jazz as we know it that is unmistakably informed by the cultural backgrounds of his new trio: a Dominican pianist (Michel Camilo), a Cuban bassist (Charles Flores) and a Cuban drummer (Dafnis Prieto). And there is the contemplative, rubato ballad, which reflects no particular identity or place. Each idea could generate a whole album, and it would be good to hear this fleet band make any of those records. But Mr. Camilo is so outward and intense a musician that the variety comes as a relief.</p>
        <p>Kartet</p>
        <p>Hardly anyone in the United States knows about the French jazz group Kartet. Until now it has never had a CD available here, and never performed here either. Let's hope that ''The Bay Window'' (Songlines) will necessitate a tour because this is a great quartet with a well-defined sound. If chamber jazz means largely composed and modest in volume, then, fine, it's chamber jazz. But it's built to be exactly what it is, not merely a detached, soigné or quiet version of something we already know. Because three of the four members are composers, the instrumental point of view keeps shifting; there are even-eighth-note lines arranged carefully over syncopated grooves, or free-time drums under a rich walking bass under a light-toned saxophone melody, or stretches when everything is precise, notated and interlocking. It's music that believes in itself, full of icy, beneficial tension.</p>
        <p>Jana Hunter</p>
        <p>Jana Hunter is another curious folk singer in Devendra Banhart's address book -- her output thus far has been on Gnomonsong, Mr. Banhart's label -- but she sounds happily uninterested in being part of a team, or any outsider-folk continuum dating to the 1960s. ''Oracle,'' ''Babies'' and other tracks on ''There's No Home,'' her second album, are upbeat, forthright and stout of construction. But sometimes Ms. Hunter plays wobbling repeated figures on her guitar, swallowing half the words in her deep, sleepy voice, making stark and mysterious songs full of a weird will, as if they're writing themselves.</p>
