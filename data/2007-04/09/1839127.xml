        <p>Imus Uproar Continues</p>
        <p>Calls for the dismissal of the syndicated radio host Don Imus continued over the weekend despite his apology for calling the players on the Rutgers University women's basketball team a bunch of ''nappy-headed ho's.'' Yesterday the Rev. DeForest B. Soaries Jr., senior pastor of the First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens in Somerset, N.J., and a former secretary of state of New Jersey, joined the chorus. At Easter services attended by C. Vivian Stringer, a parishioner who is the head coach of the Rutgers team, he called Mr. Imus's language ''vile and repulsive'' and said, ''At this point I see firing him as the only acceptable course of action.'' He added that if Mr. Imus, above, was not dismissed immediately, African-Americans and others outraged by his remarks should boycott WFAN, the New York outlet for his program, ''Imus in the Morning''; CBS Radio, which syndicates his show to more than 70 radio stations; and MSNBC, which carries a television simulcast of the show. On Saturday the Rev. Al Sharpton, who promised to picket WFAN unless Mr. Imus was fired within a week, said, ''I accept his apology, just as I want his bosses to accept his resignation.'' On Friday after Mr. Imus apologized on the air, WFAN, CBS and MSNBC condemned his original remarks. Mr. Sharpton, referring to the actor who used a racist epithet in a rant during a comedy routine last year, said: ''This is not some unemployed actor like Michael Richards. This is an established figure, allowed to use the airwaves for sexist and racist remarks.''</p>
        <p>Hispanics Seek Changes In Ken Burns Documentary</p>
        <p>A new documentary by Ken Burns, below, for PBS about World War II has come under fire from Hispanic leaders and veterans who contend that it slights Hispanic contributions to the war effort and are demanding changes, The Associated Press reported. Paula Kerger, the president and chief executive of PBS, met with leaders including the Hispanic caucus in Congress and has pledged to suggest solutions as early as this week. The 14-hour documentary, titled, ''The War,'' is to have its premiere in September.</p>
        <p>Another $23 Million For 'Blades of Glory'</p>
        <p>''Blades of Glory'' and ''Meet the Robinsons'' maintained their grip on the top spots in the weekend movie box-office rankings yesterday, while three newcomers rounded out the top five, according to estimates by the tracking company Media by Numbers. ''Blades of Glory'' (Paramount), the ice-skating comedy starring Jon Heder and Will Ferrell (from left above), gathered $23 million for the No. 1 ranking and a total of $68.3 million in its second week in release. ''Meet the Robinsons'' (Buena Vista), the G-rated 3-D computer animated film about a bespectacled orphan, took in $17 million to reach $52.2 million in its second week. Leading the newcomers was the Ice Cube home-improvement comedy ''Are We Done Yet?'' (Sony), with $15 million, good for third place. Finishing fourth was the Robert Rodriguez-Quentin Tarantino tribute to trash cinema, ''Grindhouse'' (Weinstein/Dimension), with $11.5 million, followed by the Hilary Swank horror vehicle ''The Reaping'' (Warner Brothers), which sopped up $10.8 million.</p>
        <p>Jackie Chan TV Show Searches for Kung Fu Stars</p>
        <p>The action movie star Jackie Chan, who turned 53 on Saturday, is looking for some young blood. He has begun a Chinese television competition to find new film-worthy kung fu talent, The Associated Press reported. And, he said in Beijing, more than 100,000 people have already signed up. In English the title of the television show, running until October, is ''The Disciple.'' Jointly produced by Mr. Chan, above, and the Beijing TV Station, known as BTV, it is intended to yield 10 winners who will appear in a movie to be produced by Mr. Chan and released before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, the organizers said. Many actors are good fighters, Mr. Chan said, but their style ''is not beautiful.'' So, he said, ''if you can incorporate dance with an ability to perform kung fu, that would be better.''</p>
        <p>Will Connery Keep Up With the Joneses?</p>
        <p>Sean Connery is a wanted man. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are seeking to coax him out of retirement to play the father of Indiana Jones in the fourth film about the intrepid archaeologist, Variety.com reported. Mr. Connery, 76, right, who would be cast opposite Harrison Ford, 64, in a reprise of the father-son roles they played in the third film in the series, ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' (1989), has said only that he would consider a return if he likes the script. Mr. Connery's most recent film was ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' in 2003. The fourth Indiana Jones film, as yet untitled, is to be released by Paramount Pictures next year.</p>
        <p>At 40, 'Sgt. Pepper' Gets a Salute</p>
        <p>Rock bands including Oasis, the Killers and Kaiser Chiefs plan to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' by recording their own versions of its tracks, Agence France-Presse reported. With the Fratellis, Travis, Razorlight and James Morrison, they are making cover versions of the songs for a two-hour BBC radio broadcast on June 2. The original album, released on June 1, 1967, included songs like ''A Day in the Life,'' ''Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,'' ''When I'm Sixty-Four'' and ''With a Little Help From My Friends.'' Geoff Emerick, the audio engineer who recorded ''Sgt. Pepper'' at the Abbey Road studios in London, will record the new versions using the same four-track equipment.</p>
        <p>Jailed Glam Rocker Wants Sentence Reduced</p>
        <p>The 1970's glam rocker Gary Glitter, imprisoned in Vietnam for sexually molesting two young girls, is hoping to reduce his punishment for a second time, Reuters reported. Gary Glitter, 62, whose real name is Paul Francis Gadd, was convicted last year and is not scheduled for release until August 2008, but his lawyer, Le Thanh Kinh, said he was planning to seek amnesty during celebrations of Vietnam's Liberation Day this month. The lawyer said the government had not yet announced an amnesty to mark the April 30 anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War but noted that such gestures were often made around such occasions. Mr. Glitter's three-year term was reduced by three months in a nationwide Lunar New Year amnesty in February.</p>
        <p>Major Monet Show Opens in Tokyo</p>
        <p>More than 600,000 visitors are expected at the new National Art Center in Tokyo before the close on July 2 of a major retrospective of the works of Claude Monet, who is adored in Japan, Agence France-Presse reported. ''Claude Monet and His Posterity,'' which opened over the weekend and was organized in collaboration with the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, includes nearly 100 works by Monet (1840-1926), an avid collector of Japanese woodcut prints who said Japan had inspired him to embark on a ''simplification of space.'' Besides Monet the exhibition includes dozens of artists influenced by him, from Seurat and Derain to Roy Lichtenstein. Opened in January, the National Art Center, designed by Kisho Kurokawa, has more space than any other museum in Japan but no permanent collection. It focuses on bringing exhibitions to Tokyo.</p>
