        <p>Keith Richards Admits He Was High on Dad</p>
        <p>Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones says he snorted his father's ashes mixed with cocaine, The Associated Press reported. In comments published yesterday in the British music magazine NME, Mr. Richards, 63, left, said: ''The strangest thing I've tried to snort? My father. I snorted my father. He was cremated and I couldn't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow. My dad wouldn't have cared.'' Mr. Richards added, ''It went down pretty well, and I'm still alive.'' His father, Bert, died at 84 in 2002. Mr. Richards, one of rock's wild men, cautioned young men against trying to emulate him. He attributed his survival to luck: ''I was No. 1 on the 'who's likely to die' list for 10 years. I mean, I was really disappointed when I fell off the list.''</p>
        <p>Van Gogh Stays in Detroit</p>
        <p>The Detroit Institute of Arts has won the legal right to retain a disputed van Gogh painting after a federal district court judge ruled that a family asserting ownership had waited too long to file its claim, The Associated Press reported. A parallel case involving a Gauguin painting, brought by the same family against the Toledo Museum of Art, was dismissed by an Ohio judge in December. In the Detroit case, Martha Nathan, a member of a Jewish banking family that emigrated from Germany to France in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution, sold the van Gogh, ''Les Bêcheurs'' (''The Diggers''), right, to a consortium of three dealers in Paris in 1938 for $9,360. One of the dealers sold it in 1941 for $34,000 to Robert Tannahill, a Detroit art collector who bequeathed it to the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1969. The Nathan family asserted its claim to the painting in 2004, but United States District Court Judge Denise Page Hood, citing the expiration of Michigan's statute of limitations, dismissed the case. ''It's a tremendous relief,'' said Graham Beal, director of the Detroit Institute of Arts.</p>
        <p>CBS Recruits Lou Dobbs</p>
        <p>Lou Dobbs, left, the anchor and managing editor of CNN's ''Lou Dobbs Tonight,'' is taking on an additional assignment. He has been named a special contributor to ''The Early Show'' on CBS, according to an announcement yesterday by Steve Friedman, the CBS News vice president for morning broadcasts. (Anderson Cooper of CNN has a similar arrangement with CBS as a contributor to ''60 Minutes.'') With a Peabody Award and a Lifetime Achievement Emmy among his honors, Mr. Dobbs, who joined CNN when it began in 1980, is also the anchor of the nationally syndicated news radio report ''The Lou Dobbs Financial Report.''</p>
        <p>A Modern Totem Pole For the Field Museum</p>
        <p>The Field Museum in Chicago has the latest in totem poles. It is a 15-foot-high, 3-foot-wide, 1,500-pound red-and-turquoise cedar ornament, above, that combines traditional carving styles with current techniques and features representations of a bear and birds, and an abstract, swooshing molded silicone element. Carved by a father-and-son team from a Western red cedar tree given to the museum by the Tlingit people of Cape Fox, Alaska, the new pole replaces one that was returned to the Tlingit by the museum in 2001 under the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, The Associated Press reported. That 26-foot totem pole had been removed from southeast Alaska in 1899 by a scientific expedition. Installed on Monday, the replacement was carved by Nathan Jackson, a master carver and member of the Chilkoot-Tlingit Tribe of Alaska, and his son, Stephen Jackson, a sculptor based in New York. Nathan's wife, Dorica Jackson, did much of the painting.</p>
        <p>Baby's Name Rocks Swedish Tax Board</p>
        <p>Metallica may be a swell name for a heavy-metal band. But for a 6-month-old Swedish girl? The decision by Michael and Karolina Tomaro to give the name to their child has led to a clash between them and the Swedish tax agency, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Tomaro, 27, said yesterday: ''It suits her. She's decisive and knows what she wants.'' Although Metallica has been baptized, the Swedish Tax Board, which approves names, maintains the population registry and issues personal identification numbers, has refused permission, saying Metallica was associated with the rock group and the word ''metal.'' The Tomaros appealed to the County Administrative Court in Goteborg, which ruled in their favor on March 13 and also noted that a woman in Sweden already has Metallica as her middle name. The tax agency has appealed, frustrating the family's travel plans. ''We've had to cancel trips and can't get anywhere because we can't get her a passport without an approved name,'' Ms. Tomaro said.</p>
        <p>Country Singer's Woe: A Bar, a Gun, a Shooting</p>
        <p>The country singer Billy Joe Shaver, below, was a wanted man yesterday: wanted by the police who turned him away when he tried to surrender in connection with a shooting, The Associated Press reported. His lawyer, Joseph A. Turner of Austin, Tex., said that at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, a drunken, aggressive stranger armed with a knife followed Mr. Shaver into a parking lot outside Papa Joe's Texas Saloon in Lorena, Tex., about 80 miles north of Austin, and Mr. Shaver shot him in self-defense. Mr. Turner said that Mr. Shaver tried to surrender to the police in Austin on Monday night but was not arrested because they had no record of the warrants issued for him. According to the Lorena police, the unidentified victim, who was hospitalized, was shot in the cheek. Other than to say that Mr. Shaver did not know the man, Mr. Turner declined to say what, if anything, had occurred between the two inside the bar. Mr. Shaver, who lives in Waco, 15 miles from Lorena, rose to stardom in the 1970s and has recorded more than 20 albums.</p>
